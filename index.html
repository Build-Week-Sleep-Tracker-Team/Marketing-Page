        <h2>Optimize your time</h2>
        <p>
          Everybody deserves a good time, but not everyone gets that with the
          Gregorian Calendar. In fact, thanks to erratically divided units, the
          current calendar system is not a measurement system at all! The New
          Calendar is a breakthrough calendar technology because it works with
          the naturally occuring units of the year to create evenly divided
          units that repeat with uniformity in perpetuity.

        <h2>Turn time into data</h2>
        <p>
          The Gregorian Calendar is ill-designed to gather, analyze, and track
          data. Thanks both to units that do not compound within each other
          (i.e. how many weeks in a month?), and some units that vary from one
          to the next (i.e. months and quarters), it is impossible to track
          compare and analyze data from one period to the next. This is often
          why sales and economic data is compared "year over year", otherwise a
          month to month comparison could show bad data, especially from
          February to March, when the month expands by over 10%

        <h2>Personalize your time management</h2>
        <p>
          The New Calendar offers an unparalleled potential for your time
          management needs. Units neatly compound from weeks to months and
          months to seasons. Likewise, extra mid-week units are now available
          thanks to a revolutionary weekly unit that is divisible. Never before
          has the year been so precise, accurate, and logical.
